# Atmel Ice Header Adapter 

This is the "version 1" PCB. I made a few minor changes, but the board is functionally equivalent to the original Eagle PCB.

# Gerbers

Gerbers are in the gerbers folder. There is a zip file which I use with Itead PCB service. The "gvp" file is a gerbv project file. https://sourceforge.net/projects/gerbv/
